# ExpressTrack Relaunches as a Developer-Focused Package Tracking API

ExpressTrack began as a consumer-facing package tracking service, helping users across Malaysia and Southeast Asia track their shipments from multiple carriers in one place. While the service gained traction initially, we realized the real opportunity lay elsewhere: serving the developers and businesses who need reliable tracking data integrated seamlessly into their own applications.

ExpressTrack is back, but this time we're solving a different problem. We've pivoted from consumer tracking to serve developers and businesses who need reliable package tracking integrated into their applications.

## Why Another Tracking API? Because Integration Shouldn't Be Hard

The package tracking problem has been solved - multiple times over. But here's what we kept running into as developers:

**Integration friction**: Great APIs that still require custom code for Shopify, manual webhook setup, and complex authentication flows. **No-code gaps**: Tools like Zapier have limited tracking integrations, forcing you back to custom development. **Marketplace absence**: Platform app stores treat tracking as an afterthought rather than a core e-commerce need.

**Our approach**: Integration-first development. We're building one-click platform integrations, Zapier connectivity, and marketplace distribution. Other APIs give you endpoints. We give you working integrations.

## What Makes ExpressTrack Different

**Developer-First Experience**
- Comprehensive API documentation with interactive examples
- Generous free tier for testing and small projects
- Transparent, usage-based pricing that scales with you

**Webhook-First Architecture**
- Real-time notifications instead of constant polling
- Reliable delivery with automatic retries
- Standardized payload format across all carriers

**Global Coverage with Regional Expertise**
- Extensive carrier network through strategic partnerships
- Local payment methods and currency support (planned)
- Internationalization built-in: localized dates, times, and strings

## Key Features

**For Developers**: RESTful API with clear documentation, interactive API explorer, comprehensive error handling, and rate limiting that scales with your needs.

**For Businesses**: Easy integration with popular platforms, detailed analytics dashboard, and enterprise-grade reliability.

## Getting Started

We're launching with a generous free tier perfect for testing and small projects. Our usage-based pricing means no surprises as you scale, and we're building regional payment options to make adoption as smooth as possible.

**Current focus**: Core API development and platform integrations. Shopify apps, WooCommerce plugins, and Zapier integration are in development, with marketplace distribution launching on RapidAPI and GitHub Marketplace.

## Looking Ahead

Our roadmap includes expanded regional coverage, additional platform integrations, and continuous developer experience improvements. We're committed to building based on community feedback and real-world usage patterns.
